# Face Blender
A sheet of paper is displayed with a camera above. The camera captures a live video of the audience, while a projector displays the processed result back onto the paper. This artwork is an open system because it evolves over time based on the people that view it. The blending calculation is a weighted average of the current canvas and the new faces detected. The audience interacts with the artwork by simply looking at it while being in view of the camera. The more a person views the artwork, the more the artwork will shape to reflect that person’s face. This feedback loop engages the audience with critical and meaningful dialogue about artistic identity. The blended face is a representation of diversity of installation art enthusiast. Despite our differences, we are all here staring at a “blank” sheet of paper. In a weird, Lovecraftian way the blended face serves as a collective identity of the audience.
